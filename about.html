            <p>Shelf's design is mine alone. Spanning my first year learning design, it stands as the first of many love
                letters to humanity. Learn more about the thinking behind it in the Shelf Research & Design White
                Paper, attached in the Shelf product page.</p>
            <p>In Decision was designed and developed at Carnegie Mellon University, Fall 2024. It was formed by a
                group of six students as part of a Ken Holstein's Human Computer Interaction Institute course on
                Augmenting Intelligence.</p>
            <p>Graphic depicted in 'What is Design' is inspired from Dieter Rams' 1964 T 1000 World Receiver and is the
                intellectual property of Braun.</p>
